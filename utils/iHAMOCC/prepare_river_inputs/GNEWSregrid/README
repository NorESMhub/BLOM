Matlab/Octave scripts for creating BLOM/iHAMOCC river nutrient input files

JÃ¶rg Schwinger  20-02-2025  based on scripts originally by Shuang Gao


These set of scripts reads in river nutrient data from GNEWS2 data base and either interpolates to 
the BLOM model grid or puts the data on a regular 0.5x0.5 grid (the so-called run-off grid). The GNEWs 
input data is located in excel files in the sub-directory RiverineData. In order to run these script, the 
relevant data has been extracted into .csv files.

If the data needs to be interpolated onto the model grid, grid files and mapping files are needed. These
can be copied from the NorESM inputdata directory $INP_ROOT/ocn/blom/grid/ and $INP_ROOT/cpl/cpl6/ where
$INP_ROOT is the base-path of the NorESM input data directory (/cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata/ on betzy).
Note the script expects the grid filenames without a date tag, so it should be created a link, e.g. 
grid_tnx1v4.nc -> grid_tnx1v4_20170622.nc

The mapping files used for the grids used in NorESM1/2 are as follows:

map_r05_to_gx1v6_e1000r300_090226.nc
map_r05_to_tnx2v1_e1000r300_130206.nc
map_r05_to_tnx1v2_e1000r300_140828.nc
map_r05_to_tnx1v4_e1000r300_170609.nc
map_r05_to_tnx0.5v1_e300r100_20240702.nc
map_r05_to_tnx0.25v4_e300r100_170629.nc
