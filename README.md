- This repository does not include grid files. Grid files are generated by running the python script "make_region_and_index_files.py" in the "regions_and_indices" folder.
- See the file "build/HOWTO_build" for istructions about how to build and run the stand-alone BLOM model. The model setup is based on the framework provided by FRAM and BETZY, so will likely need modifications for other computers.
