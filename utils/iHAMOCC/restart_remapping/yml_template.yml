# InterpCase provides different ways to interpolate the data from tnx2 to tnx1
#  - isopycnic_interp:   just do an interpolation along the isopycnic layers
#                        NOTE: this is very limited with potential issues in empty layers
#                              and reqires to hold the same number of purely isopyncnic levels 
#  - sigma_plvl_interp:  interpolate pressure and data to fine grid and then vertically interpolate 
#                        to different pressure levels of the fine sigma/hybrid coordinates
#  - levitus_plvl_inter: interpolate to levitus pressure/depth levels, interpolate horizontally,
#                        and performa vertical interpolation to isopycnal pressure levels
#                        NOTE: Not yet implemented
#  - skip_interp:        enables to pass the previously written new restart file directly 
#                        on to the AdjustInventory routine, if needed 
#                        Requires:
#                            - previously written new restart file (with un-adjusted inventories)
#                            - coarse HAMOCC file information (to get the inventories of variables)
#                            - coarse BLOM file information (to calculate the inventory of coarse HAMOCC)
#                            - fine BLOM file information (to calculate the current and ajusted inventory)
