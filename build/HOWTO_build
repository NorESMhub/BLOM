# set the environment and update Makefile
source setintel_FRAM
make depend
# and then manually, in the Makefile, for blom.f you need to change the FFLAG to
#-real-size 64 -mkl=cluster -fp-model source -qno-opt-dynamic-align -convert big_endian -assume byterecl -ftz -O3
# this is because the main program cannot be compiled with other than -O3 option
make clean
make

Now execute model and it is for 1 month:

cd ../BLOM_channel_new01/
./run.sh_normal_betzy #it runs model for 1 months on 64 processors; we set 4 nodes as short queue time limit was bit lower 
#it would also be nice to go through makefiles and run.sh_normal_betzy
