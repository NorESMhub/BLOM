# Contributing to BLOM/iHAMOCC
We welcome contributions to the BLOM/iHAMOCC model, including bug reports and fixes, contributions for code improvements, and suggestions for feature enhancements or inclusion of new features.

The latest version of the BLOM/iHAMOCC source code is hosted on github:
https://github.com/NorESMhub/BLOM

We encourage using the [issue ticket](https://github.com/NorESMhub/BLOM/issues) system in github to get in touch with the model developers regarding any questions or suggestions you might have.

BLOM/iHAMOCC is the ocean circulation model and ocean BGC model component of the [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) model system. The most common use of BLOM/iHAMOCC is as an integrated part of NorESM, and the documentation for BLOM/iHOMACC is therefore also integrated with the [NorESM documentation](https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Please feel free to drop us a note through the issue tracker if you don't find answers to your questions there.

## Reporting bugs
If you find bugs, strange output or something puzzling, please raise an issue. No issue is too big nor too small. Before creating a new issue, we would be grateful if you first check existing issues in case the bug has already been reported. In this case you may want to add your comments to the existing bug report.

Please consider providing additional information with your bug report, e.g.
- model version for BLOM/iHAMOCC and/or NorESM
- HPC platform and environment settings
- Model settings (compset, grid resolution, etc.)
- Error messages, log output

## Suggesting new features or feature enhancements
An issue can also be raised to make suggestions for new features or feature enhancements, or to get in touch with members of the core BLOM/iHAMOCC development team regarding more general questions about the model system. If a suggestion is approved by the development team, we might also provide suggestions or limited assistance for the implementation of new solutions.

The basic steps for adding code to the BLOM/iHAMOCC model is as follows:
1. Create an issue to describe the feature enhancement or new feature that you wish to implement.
2. Fork the repository if you wish to contribute code.
3. Submit changes for review through pull requests.

Please consult the [BLOM wiki page](https://github.com/NorESMhub/BLOM/wiki) for further details about the BLOM repository structure and how we work with the repository.
